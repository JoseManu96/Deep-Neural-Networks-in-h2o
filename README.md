In this script we use the R packege h2o to develop a DNN model using the popular datase MNIST and we train our model with a part of that dataset, looking for a high score in the validation. Even if the final score obtained do not appear in the script, we obteined and accuracy of 98.52 %. We use a CNN to make some predicts too, and as anyone can imagine the accuracy was higher than the DNN model, 99.1 %.

In the other problem we use some knowns methods of supervised learning to make predictions of the dataset MNIST too, so we can compare all the methods previously mentioned.
